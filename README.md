# CODE_EXP 2022 - App Development

## Group : BrainCells

## Contributors: Shen Hwei, Zi En, Joanne, Apurva

## Problem Statement : "How can we leverage digital technologies to enable greater convenience and flexibility for our NS men in the workspaces in which they live, work add play"

## Proposed Solution : National Service Convenience (NSC) 

## Prototype : 
Refer to the [Figma link here](https://www.figma.com/file/5Z9ncpLDCIAwr84VrqSFGB/Prototype---NSC?node-id=0%3A1)

## Main Feature(s) : 

1. Reporting System 
  - Voting System 
  - Algorithm to prevent spam reports 
  - Camera Feature 
  - Status of Report shown as Pending/ Completed
2. Reports near You : allows users to see what reports has been made by users aroud that area 


## Advantages of our App :
1. Convenience & Flexibility 
  - Current QR Code implementation for fault reporting can be inconvenient. 
  - With our app, the NS community can report anytime, anywhere without the need to paste QR codes and search for QR codes. 

2. Creating a closer community 
  - We heard NSMen expressed that NS is a highly top-down approach, therefore, sometimes, they may not feel heard by the top. This app allows everyone to voice their concerns, allowing them to feel more heard by the top. 
  - This potentially creates a closer NS community. 

## Discussion/ Limitations : Although this would be a great platform for feedback from NSMen, more thought needs to be put into HOW we can motivate them to use such platform. For example, do they receive any incentives? Perhaps, they may even feel that it's sufficient to have their voices heard. Further, how can we ensure that users do not abuse such a platform?
